You can use this Makefile for Hw2.
It is assumed that your having four source files p1.cc, p2.cc, p3.cc, p4.cc, as well as image.h and image.cc (note thad DisjSets.h and DisjSets.cc is also assumed to be used - if you are not using DisjSets, then delete the DisjSets.o from the Makefile line CC_OBJ_2=...). If you want to add other source files you can do so by modifying the Makefile. But you should keep at least the files listed here.
